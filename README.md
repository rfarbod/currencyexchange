# Introduction

This is a simple exchange app that lets people swap different currencies
<br>
I chose **Redux** as a design pattern for this project because of its testablity and maintainability.
<br>
I chose **SwiftUI** instead of UIKit because redux is a reactive architecture and SwiftUI is way more reactive-friendly and I think it's cool to try some new frameworks specially when developing non-production apps.
